# busbar-auth-ldap

The AD/LDAP auth module as a droppable busbar plugin: a cdylib exporting the auth C ABI. Drop it in the plugins folder, define it once under identity-providers.<name> (module: ldap, settings: url, bind_dn_template, base_dn, group_attr) and reference that name from auth.chain.

[![Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/GetBusbar/busbar-auth-ldap/branch/dev/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/GetBusbar/busbar-auth-ldap)

The first-party, signed `kind: auth` plugin for
[busbar](https://getbusbar.com) that authenticates a username and
password against an AD/LDAP directory: a real LDAP/LDAPS **BIND** as the
credential check, a group read off the bound user, and a group-DN → role
mapping that hands busbar a `Principal` it can bind to virtual keys and
roles.

It is a `cdylib` exporting one busbar 1.6.0 plugin door
(`busbar_plugin_door`, a `plugin_door!` over the auth kind's table,
`abi::auth` v3, from
[`busbar-contract`](https://github.com/GetBusbar/busbar/tree/main/crates/busbar-contract)),
loaded in-process by busbar — `dlopen`'d, not spawned as a separate
process — or linked into a busbar build as a compiled-in row through the
same door. It declares `contract_abi` 3 (`auth-ldap/declares.json`).

It is a **separate plugin from `busbar-auth-oidc`**, and takes a
different shape: OIDC is a redirect flow where the core executes the
token-exchange HTTP hop, while LDAP is a direct credential flow where the
plugin speaks the directory's wire protocol itself, as a sans-IO codec
over a byte stream the host connector owns. The plugin opens no socket
and does no TLS.

### The login flow

1. A user types a username and password on busbar's hosted login page.
   The door's Statement declares a credential login kind, so the method
   chooser renders a form rather than a redirect button, without having
   to call `begin_login` first.
2. `begin_login` answers the form, declaring two fields — `username`
   (text) and `password` (password) — which the core renders and POSTs
   back to `/auth/token`.
3. `complete_login` reads those values back out of the submitted fields,
   keyed by the field names the plugin declared; the password rides a
   secret blob and is exposed only for the bind.
4. The plugin asks the host connector for a stream on its one declared
   need (outbound, a raw `tcp` stream, egress class
   `operator-infrastructure`), secured by the connector for `ldaps://` or
   after the StartTLS extended operation for `start_tls`, and BINDs with
   the user's DN and password over it. That bind *is* the credential
   check — no token, no redirect. While the stream pends, `complete_login`
   answers PENDING and resumes on the wake; nothing is sent twice.
5. On a successful bind it reads the user's group memberships
   (`memberOf` by default) and answers the identity, subject
   `ldap:<the full lowercased bind DN>` and groups set from the mapped
   group names. A wrong credential answers a bad-credential verdict; a
   directory that cannot answer (connect, TLS, timeout) answers an
   outage.

Because LDAP is a login method rather than a data-plane bearer verifier,
`verify` answers `Pass` — "not my credential shape" — and the auth chain
continues.

There is no `client_secret`: a credential method is not a confidential
OAuth client, so `LdapConfig` has no such field and
`deny_unknown_fields` rejects one if it is configured.

### Design

This repo is a same-repo, 2-crate Cargo workspace, mirroring `auth-oidc`:
`auth-ldap/` (the `busbar-auth-ldap` library — the real LDAP BIND,
group-read and role-mapping logic, and its door, `door::door`) and
`auth-ldap-plugin/` (the `busbar-auth-ldap-plugin` cdylib, which only
exports that door with `export_door!`). A custom build links the
library crate and registers `door::door` as a compiled-in row.

LDAP work is done by the plugin's own sans-IO codec (`ber.rs`,
`filter.rs`, `codec.rs`: the requests 1.5.5's `ldap3` client wrote, byte
for byte, and the replies read fail-closed), driven over the host's stream
by `conversation.rs`. No call blocks, so the Statement states no `blocks`
mark, and the plugin carries no LDAP client, socket or TLS crate.

Two directory shapes are supported:

- **Direct bind** — `bind_dn_template` turns the username into a DN
  (`uid={username},ou=people,dc=corp,dc=example`) and the plugin binds as
  that DN, then reads the groups off that same entry. The template must
  expand to a DN: one with no `=` (an AD UPN such as
  `{username}@corp.example`) is refused at boot.
- **Search-then-bind** — set `user_search_filter` (e.g.
  `(sAMAccountName={username})`, or
  `(userPrincipalName={username}@corp.example)` for AD UPN logins, where
  users type the bare name as they did with 1.5.5's UPN template) and the
  plugin first binds as `bind_service_dn`, locates the user entry, then
  re-binds as the DN it found. This is the mode for Active Directory.

A crafted username cannot inject DN components or filter syntax: on the
DN template path a username carrying a DN special character (`,` `=` `+`
`<` `>` `;` `\` `"`, or a control character) is rejected, and on the
search filter path the username is RFC 4515-escaped.

## Config

Configured like any other busbar auth method — an entry under
`identity-providers:` referenced by name from `auth.chain`:

```yaml
identity-providers:
  corp-ldap:                 # the NAME is the instance; `module:` is the plugin behind it
    module: ldap
    settings:
      url: "ldaps://ad.corp.example:636"
      bind_dn_template: "cn={username},cn=users,dc=corp,dc=example"
      base_dn: "dc=corp,dc=example"
      user_search_filter: "(userPrincipalName={username}@corp.example)"
      bind_service_dn: "cn=busbar-svc,cn=users,dc=corp,dc=example"
      bind_service_password: "<service account password>"
      role_from: cn

auth:
  chain: [keys, corp-ldap]   # built-ins (`keys`, `admin-tokens`) are referenced bare
```

Group-to-role mapping is keyed by that same provider name:

```yaml
auth:
  role_bindings:
    corp-ldap:
      engineers: { group: engineering }
```

| Setting | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `url` | yes | — | `ldaps://host:636` (implicit TLS), or `ldap://host:389` for plaintext/STARTTLS. |
| `bind_dn_template` | yes | — | Turns a username into the bind DN. Must contain `{username}`; validated at boot. In direct-bind mode it must expand to a DN (contain `=`). |
| `base_dn` | yes | — | Search base for the search-then-bind user lookup. May be empty for a directory that serves a search from base `""` (the AD Global Catalog, OpenLDAP with `olcDefaultSearchBase`). (The group read is a base read of the bound user's own entry.) |
| `group_attr` | no | `memberOf` | The attribute on the user entry listing group memberships. Each value is a group DN. Must not be empty. |
| `role_from` | no | `cn` | How a group DN becomes a role string: `cn` takes the value of the first `CN=` RDN in the directory's own case (a value with no `CN=` RDN is used whole, trimmed); `dn` uses the full DN, trimmed and lowercased. `role_bindings` keys must match that spelling exactly. |
| `user_search_filter` | no | — | Enables search-then-bind. Must contain `{username}`; requires `bind_service_dn`. |
| `bind_service_dn` | no | — | Service-account DN used for the search-then-bind lookup. |
| `bind_service_password` | no | — | Service-account password. Held in a redacting wrapper; see [Limitations](#limitations). |
| `ca_cert_pem` | no | — | Reserved. A config that sets it is **rejected at boot** — see [Limitations](#limitations). |
| `start_tls` | no | `false` | Use STARTTLS over an `ldap://` connection instead of implicit LDAPS. |
| `allow_insecure_transport` | no | `false` | Override the plaintext-transport guard. See below. |
| `timeout_secs` | no | `10` | Connect and operation timeout, in seconds. Must be at least 1. |

Unknown config fields are rejected (`deny_unknown_fields`) — a typo'd or
stray key fails loudly at boot instead of being silently ignored.

A plaintext `ldap://` URL pointing at a **non-loopback** host with no
STARTTLS is rejected at config time: it would put the service-account
password and every end-user password on the wire in the clear.
`allow_insecure_transport: true` knowingly overrides that guard for a
trusted, isolated segment. It is a no-op for `ldaps://`, for STARTTLS,
and for a loopback host.

### Limitations

- **`ca_cert_pem` is not wired.** The field deserializes for forward
  compatibility, but the custom-CA TLS path is not implemented, so
  `LdapModule::new` **rejects** a config that sets it. Accepting and
  ignoring it would silently fall back to the system trust roots while
  the operator believed a private CA was in use. Use a system-trusted
  certificate until this lands.
- **The service-account password is a secret reference.** The Statement
  names `bind_service_password` in its `secret_refs`, so the kernel
  resolves it into `OpenIn.secrets`, which wins; a 1.5.5 literal in the
  settings is still accepted. Either way the plugin holds it in a
  redacting newtype (`Debug` prints `[REDACTED]`; there is no `Display`;
  plaintext reachable only through an explicit `expose()`).
- **Fail-closed differences from 1.5.5 (owner-signed, 2026-09-28).** A
  malformed reply or a URL that names no host is an outage instead of a
  panic; a nested BER length that overruns its parent fails at once
  instead of waiting for bytes that never come; an inbound message past
  16 MiB is refused from its header.
- **A directory outage answers its own verdict** (`LOGIN_OUTAGE`,
  distinct from a bad credential), and the plugin logs the operational
  detail (never the credential) at `warn`.
- **Group DNs are normalized by the plugin, not the engine.** LDAP and
  AD groups are DNs (`CN=engineers,OU=Groups,DC=corp,DC=example`), which
  make hostile `role_bindings` keys: commas and `=` are awkward in YAML,
  LDAP compares case-insensitively while the map does not, and the OU
  path is deployment-specific. `role_from` picks the shape;
  `cn` is the default for that reason.
- **Group collection is capped** at 4096 values per user entry, so a
  hostile or misconfigured directory cannot drive unbounded memory use.
  The plugin logs when it truncates.

## Build

Needs a Rust toolchain ([rustup](https://rustup.rs)); `rust-toolchain.toml` pins
the version CI uses. busbar is a pinned git dependency (see
[Dependencies](#dependencies) below).

```sh
cargo build --release      # cdylib: target/release/libbusbar_auth_ldap_plugin.{so,dylib}
cargo test                 # unit tests + the end-to-end loader test
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

### Dependencies

`busbar-auth-ldap` (`auth-ldap/`) is a same-repo crate; `auth-ldap-plugin`
depends on it as a normal workspace path dependency (`../auth-ldap`).

The one [busbar](https://github.com/GetBusbar/busbar) crate either crate
names is `busbar-contract` — the plugin contract, whose `abi::sdk` module
carries the export macros. `busbar-plugin-loader` is a dev-dependency only,
for the linked + dropped-in conformance test and the end-to-end test. Both
are **git dependencies pinned to one busbar commit**: the `rev` in every
`Cargo.toml` is field 1 of `.busbar-ref`, and CI's `pin` job refuses a
manifest that disagrees. No sibling checkout of busbar is needed to build
or test; the live end-to-end test (`tests/e2e.rs`) builds the real `busbar`
binary from a checkout named by `BUSBAR_CHECKOUT` (CI's `e2e` job provides
one at `.busbar-ref`).

### Pack and sign

Once built, the cdylib is packed and signed like any other busbar plugin
— see
[`docs/plugins.md`](https://github.com/GetBusbar/busbar/blob/main/docs/plugins.md#signing-and-packaging)
in busbar for the full reference. In short:

```sh
BUSBAR_SIGN_KEY=<signing key> busbar-plugin-pack pack \
    --lib target/release/libbusbar_auth_ldap_plugin.so \
    --name busbar-auth-ldap-plugin --alias ldap --kind auth \
    --version 0.1.0 --publisher busbar \
    --license Apache-2.0 \
    --out busbar-auth-ldap-plugin-0.1.0-x86_64-linux.tar.gz
```

For local development without a signing key, `busbar-plugin-pack pack
--allow-unsigned` produces a tarball busbar loads only under
`plugins.trust.allow_unsigned: true`. Drop the resulting tarball into
busbar's configured `plugins.dir`.

## Tests

`cargo test` runs the library crate's unit tests (`auth-ldap/src/tests.rs`)
and the plugin crate's. Coverage includes config parsing and
`deny_unknown_fields` (including `client_secret` being rejected),
bind-DN templating and LDAP-injection rejection, RFC 4515 filter
escaping, group-DN → role mapping (CN and DN forms, dedup, escaped
commas), and the login guards for a missing or empty field. The door
(`auth-ldap/src/door.rs`) is driven through busbar's real loader, linked
and dropped in, by `auth-ldap-plugin/tests/conformance.rs`: `verify`'s
pass, the `begin_login` form, the `complete_login` verdicts, and the
lifecycle's refusal texts.

The live-bind happy path is integration-only: `auth-ldap-plugin/tests/e2e.rs`
packs the real cdylib with the `busbar-plugin-pack` binary, drives a
spawned busbar binary over real HTTP, and seeds a real OpenLDAP instance
over plaintext LDAP with a dev-only `ldap3` client. A second live test
drives the library module's codec (over the test's own stream) straight
against that directory in both
direct-bind and search-then-bind mode and checks the mapped role. Point
`BUSBAR_TEST_LDAP_URL` at that directory to run them; with the variable
unset they skip loudly, and under CI (`CI` set) they fail instead.
